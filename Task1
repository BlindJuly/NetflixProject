print('Number of different genres:', len(set(df['Genre'])))              #so you can sort of treat it like a list or set.  Since this asked for "DIFFERENT genres" i turned into explicitly into a set() because sets don't have repeatable elements

sold_list2 = [int(i) for i in sold_list]                                 #by using i.replace() in line 11.  Then converted all the elements in the object to int() because they are by default strings.  Then simply summed the list.
print('Total number of tickets sold:', sum(sold_list2))                  # I tried removing commas and converting to int in one list comprehension but couldn't get it to work.  IDK if that's even possible.
